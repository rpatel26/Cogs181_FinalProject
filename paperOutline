Abstract
-Do last. Should be a brief summary of the entire paper.

Introduction
-Introduce the topic, our initial feelings, what we hope to do.

Methods
-Logistic Regression to obtain initial estimates of features important to genre classification.
-KMeans to see if those features are statistically significant.
-MLP to use deep learning to improve upon genre classification accuracy of more standard machine learning methods.

Results
-Lay out all of the results from above. Don't go into our explanations or ideas about why they occur.
-Logistic Regression: Validity as a classifier, our lists of statistically significant features.
-KMeans: Whether or not our clusters after taking out the statistically significant features resemble them before
and what meaning this has on their ability to differentiate one genre of music from another.
-MLP: Optimal hyperparameters for music genre classification, whether or not Single Multiclass Categorization or 
Multiple Binary Categorization perform better.

Discussion
-Discuss the results and compare them to those in our reference papers.
